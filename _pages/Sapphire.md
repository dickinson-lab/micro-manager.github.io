Notes from Kyle Douglass (2018):

\- Be sure that the Local/Remote switch on the back of the CDRH control
box is **set to Local**. Remote in this case refers to analog control,
whereby an external voltage signal can set the power and state of the
laser. Setting it to Local allows us to control the laser through a
serial interface.

\- The Micro-Manager device adapter for this laser is called **Sapphire
Laser**.

\- The baud rate for the laser's serial communications **must be set to
19200 bps**. Anything else and you will not be able to communicate with
it. The terminating characters are either CR or LF.


Notes from Ernest van der Wee (2025):

\- When using the Sapphire OEM USB controller, set the DelayBetweenCharsMs 
to 500. If not, the readback of the power of the laser will be faulty. 
This command interval is advised in the manual.
